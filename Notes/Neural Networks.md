* **Neuron** : In simple words, it is a thing that holds a number
	* basically the grayscale value in case of number identification
	* The number inside these neurons is known as Activation Number
* These Neurons combine and form a layer and Inside our neural network model there could be several layer between the input layer and the output layer
