* This model creates a boundary with margins (margin = the distance between the boundary and the nearest data points from each class.)
* The nearest data points from each class is called Support Vectors
* It is a good model for binary classification as it sets margins and boundaries
* If the classes that cannot be seperated by a straight line we use kernel functions
* Linear seperable dataset also uses linear kernel 
* But for other datasets different kernels can be used - 'rbf, poly, sigmoid'
* With kernel we transform the data into higher dimension and then find a new boundary
