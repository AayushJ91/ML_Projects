* ROC stands for Reciever Operator Characteristics
* It is a graphhical representation of binary classification model for different threshold values
* y-axis shows the True Positive Rate (TPR) in simple words it is sensitivity (recall)
* x-axis shows the False Positive Rate (FPR) which is (1 - Specificity)
* ROC graph summarizes the confusion matrix of different thresholds for a classification task
* for different models of classifications, the model having the large AUC (Area Under Curve) will be a better classifier
* AUC varies between 0 and 1
* False Positive Rate is often replaced by the precision
* For a point in ROC curve the y projection shows the percentage of how many positive predictions are actually true
* and the x projection shows the percentage of how many positive predictions are wrongly predicted
