* High Variance means Overfitting - less error in training dataset and more error in test dataset
* High Bias means Underfitting - the errors in both dataset is high but they are high in themselves
* Perfect model - Low bias and Low Variance
* Variance means the distribution of datapoints in the dataset (High Var - more distribution, Low Vae - less distribution)
* Bias means the distance between the datapoints and the truth
