 TF IDF :- Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
* Term Frequency (TF) = ocurance of a particular word in a document / total words of that document
* IDF = log (Total Entries / number of documents where that word is occuring)
* TfIdf = TF*IDF
* Now we will calculate the TF-IDF of each word for each entry
